# SsgWebpackPlugin

:warning: This package is at its initial development stage. It should not be considered stable.

SsgWebpackPlugin is an unopinionated static-site-generation plugin for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

It crawls inside the directory you speficify, compiles to Node.js the modules it finds there, hands them to your `render` function that generates an HTML string out of it and emits the resulting assets. And all of that happens at build time.

Why it's awesome:

- It enables you to have a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)-like setup;
- Use it to statically generate your whole application or just a part of it (e.g. the blog);
- It integrates seamlessly into your [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) setup.

## Installation

With npm:

```bash
npm install ssg-webpack-plugin --save-dev --save-exact
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn add ssg-webpack-plugin --dev --exact
```

We encourage you to install an exact version of the package. It's because, as stated in the [SemVer Specification](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-4), anything may change at any time during the initial development stage.

## Usage

```js
// webpack.config.js

import path from "node:path";

import HtmlWebpackPlugin from "html-webpack-plugin";
import SsgWebpackPlugin from "ssg-webpack-plugin";
import React from "react";

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    new SsgWebpackPlugin({
      entry: path.join("src", "_app.js"),
      pagesDirectory: path.join("src", "pages"),
      render: ({ default: App }, { default: Page }) => {
        return makeHtml(App, Page);
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Options

### `documentAsset`

- Type: `string | undefined`
- Default: `undefined`

If you're using an other plugin (typically HtmlWebpackPlugin) to generate the HTML layout document, set this to the name of the emitted asset. It will later be passed as an argument to the `render` function.

### `entry`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `path.join("src", "_app.js")`

Absolute or relative path to the entry point.

### `exclude`

- Type: `RegExp | undefined`
- Default: `undefined`

Regular expression tested against every page path. If it matches, the path is excluded.

### `include`

- Type: `RegExp | undefined`
- Default: `undefined`

Regular expression tested against every page path. If it matches, the path is included.

### `outBasePath`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `"/"`

Base path for the plugin's assets.

### `outPathFormat`

- Type: `"compact" | "indexed"`
- Default: `"indexed"`

Strategy for the asset path generation:

- If `"compact"`, `contact.js` will output `contact.html`;
- If `"indexed"`, `contact.js` will output `contact/index.html`.

### `pagesDirectory`

- Type: `string`
- Default: `path.join("src", "pages")`

Absolute or relative path to the pages directory.

### `recursive`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`

Determines whether or not the pages directory should be crawled recursively.

### `render`

- Type: `function`
- Default: `undefined`

<details>

<summary>Signature</summary>

```ts
type Render = (
  appModule: Module,
  pageModule: Module,
  documentAsset: string | undefined
) => string;
```

</details>

Function that will be called for each page and that's responsible for generating the HTML to be emitted.

It takes in the entry module, the page module and the parsed document if `documentAsset` was set.
